=== A NOVEL THREE-DIMENSIONAL CONTACT MODEL FOR GRANULATES INCORPORATING ROLLING AND TWISTING RESISTANCES ===

This is implementation of a 3D contact model incorporating rolling and twisting resistances at inter-particle contact, 
to simulate the mechanical behavior of particulates.
The DMT formulation is also considered (for adhesive particles, rigid and small bodies).
